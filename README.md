# Sudoku Showdown!
Get ready for an electrifying Sudoku showdown! Since I was a child, this mind-boggling game has captured my heart and ignited my passion. The memories of my awe-inspiring grandma conquering a book full of these puzzles are forever etched in my mind. Brace yourself for an exhilarating journey into the world of Sudoku, where the thrill of solving this tantalizing grid will leave you on the edge of your seat!
## How to play
The concept is simple: ensure that each column, row, and box contains numbers 1 to 9 without repetition. You will be provided with starter numbers in various boxes on the board, and it will be your job to fill in the remaining blanks. You will start with five lives, and for every mistake you make, you will lose a life. If you run out of lives, you lose the game.

## Potential Roadblocks
*I forsee the logic behind creating a solution being rather difficult\
*I also forsee the way the starting numbers being arranged on gameStart being hard to guage weather or not the puzzle will be too hard to solve
